## Presentation: Binary Exploitation Fundamentals

This is a presentation that I prepared for my Firewalls and Network Security
class. In it I demonstrate the most basic binary exploitation method, the buffer
overflow, and develop a working arbitrary code execution exploit on a 32-bit,
non-randomized, executable stack binary.

This repository includes:

* The files used, including source code, binaries, and images
* Pre-made exploits using Python 2 (not used in the presentation)

Torrent files for the following large files:
* A prerecorded version of the presentation in single-take video format
* An importable VirtualBox appliance of the virtual machine used

The torrent files should work with any modern torrent client. I recommend using
qBittorrent.
